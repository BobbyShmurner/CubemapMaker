# CubemapMaker
Create 360 Cubemaps from within Unity games

## Usage

Press "F10" to capture a Cubemap

The image will be saved to The ULTRAKILL's Cyber Grind Skybox folder by default, but in edge cases where the plugin could not find this folder (or you aren't planning on using this for ULTRAKILL), it will be saved in a folder in your Pictures directory named "Cubemaps"

You can find the `config.cfg` in `%AppData%/CubemapMaker/`. There you can change the output path, the capture key, and the output resolution.

While this plugin was developed with ULTRAKILL in mind, this mod works with most Unity games. This image was taken in the main menu of Muck:
